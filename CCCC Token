    "description": "Cardano Community Charity Coin is the first answer to some of the holes needed to be filled in a default DeFi system. CCCC is designed to dissuade dumps via an expressive fee
structure that rewards holders for not selling. This is essential to fulfill the role of long term
savings in the Cardano Ecosystem. As the community grows and evolves, we will make charitable donations to those in need as well as to the progression of decentralizded blockchain technology. CCCC will become the cornerstone of a new era in real world DeFi.",
